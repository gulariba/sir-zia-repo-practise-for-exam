//let and const are two relatively new concepts for variable 
//declarations in JavaScript. As we mentioned earlier, let is similar
// to var in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common 
//“gotchas” that users run into in JavaScript.

//const is an augmentation of let in that it prevents re-assignment
// to a variable.

//With TypeScript being an extension of JavaScript, the language 
//naturally supports let and const.
let myIdname :string = "Areeba Ahmed Khan";
console.log(myIdname);  // in let we change value my times and reassign value also

const myaccountnumber ="012345678";
console.log(myaccountnumber);  // in const we not change vriable value
